Hashtags: #rustlang #buildtool #developmenttool  
My projects on Github are more like a tutorial than a finished product: [bestia-dev tutorials](https://github.com/bestia-dev/tutorials_rust_wasm).

## Try it

Install the binary:

```bash
cargo install dev_bestia_cargo_completion
```

Save definition for auto_completion in bash:

```bash
complete -C "dev_bestia_cargo_completion" cargo
```

Start typing `cargo b` and press `tab`.  
It should auto-complete to `cargo build`.  
Congratulation! You just used auto-completion :-)  

## bash auto completion

Auto-completion in Debian bash is a great tool. You type the first letters, press tab and the word is auto-completed.  
Bash can call an executable binary to return the available words. So it can be written in Rust. This can produce even better results as known as `dynamic auto-completion`.  
For my knowledge `cargo` does not have auto-completion yet. There are many plans. It can take some time.  
I will build what I need now. Something simple. It doesn't need to be perfect.  
This is a great blog:

## complete, the Linux command

The Linux command `complete` adds auto_completion definitions to bash.  
But it is only for the current session. If you want to make it persistent add it to you `~/.bashrc` file. Or to some other file that runs commands on initialization of the bash.  

```bash
# list the definitions
complete
# delete a definition
complete -r cargo
# define a binary to auto-complete the command
complete -C "binary" command
# for example
complete -C "dev_bestia_cargo_completion" cargo
```

## development

I choose this long name for my crate, because cargo-completion is a hot topic. Sooner or later someone will build it - officially. This is why I added the prefix `dev_bestia_`, because my web domain is [bestia.dev](https://bestia.dev). This way I have the guarantee of a unique name and leave the short name to the future official version.  
Run

```bash
cargo install cargo-auto
```

and then list the user-defined automation tasks with

```bash
cargo auto
```  

You can change the definition for bash auto-completion to point to the compilation of this project in development. So you can easy test the auto-completion while developing it.

```bash
complete -C "/home/luciano/rustprojects/dev_bestia_cargo_completion/target/debug/dev_bestia_cargo_completion" cargo
```

## cargo crev reviews and advisory

We leave in times of danger with [supply chain attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack).  
It is recommended to always use [cargo-crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev)  
to verify the trustworthiness of each of your dependencies.  
Please, spread this info.  
You can also read reviews quickly on the web. Example for the crate `num-traits`:  
<https://web.crev.dev/rust-reviews/crate/num-traits/>  

## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful, please buy me a beer by donating to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
